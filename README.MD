#Project Specifications and Considerations

- What design patterns did you use?

This project uses Node, Sequelize ORM, ES6 async and await and an MVC design structure. CRUD operations (the requirements only specified read) are used through the project.I used SOLID design patterns as much as possible, there is always a trade off between reusability and loose coupling as in the movie by attributes endpoint.

- How would you test your application?

To test this application I would use standardized basedata, and unit testing with Mocha.

- What ways could you structure the code to make it easy to understand and maintain?

When structuring code I try to use obvious naming conventions, predictable patterns, and small functions. Also it si important to have clear and explict error messages.

- What other considerations and tradeoffs did you make when building the application?

I would say the biggest tradeoffs, are when to use a join and when to preform second query. I know that for small applications like this joins are not as time consuming.

Also what data to send back to the user, in some cases the joins left data with object with one item in it, where we wouldn't need a whoel object for one attribute.
